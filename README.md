## This is my first app with WebRTC.  

To try this project out, I'd like to ask you to work on a couple of things...

  Firstly, please run the scripts below on your root repository through your terminal
    
    npx peerjs --port 3001  
  
  Pleaes type this script on another terminal, 
  
    node server.js
  
  And then access http://localhost:3000/
  
  ## How does it work?
  This is a plain video chat app. 
  When you access the localhost, you'll see your face on the browser. (I know it's an exciting but awkward moment...lol)  anyway, you can find the address got longer such as "http://localhost:3000/fdafda-123fda...". ( the letters following "...:3000/" is a room id. ) Please copy the whole address.
  
   And then, open a new tab and paste the address on the address bar. you can see your face on your browser again. (I realized my face at coding looks like a tree bark...)

   Lastly, back to the first tab and refresh the page. you'll see 2 of your faces on your screen. (a nightmare for me)
      

        
   I learned webRTC from this youtube show.

 I'll be happy if you enjoy it.
